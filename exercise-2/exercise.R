  # 1. Create training and testing datasets by sampling 75% of your data from your `homes` dataframe.
  train_ind <- sample(seq_len(nrow(homes)), size = sample.size)
  
  train <- homes[train_ind, ]
  test <- homes[-train_ind, ]
  
  # 2. Pass your **training data** to the `rpart` function to run a simple classification operation
  fit <- rpart(price ~ ., data=train, method="class")
  
  # 3. Pass your results to the `AssessFit` function to assess the fit
  fit_assess <- AssessFit(fit, outcome="price")
  
  # 4. Store your assessment in the `basic.fits` vector
  basic.fits <- c(basic.fits, fit_assess)
}

# 5. Make a histogram of your `basic.fits` vector


# 6. Take the mean of your `basic.fits` vector



# 7. Pass your most recent model to the `rpart.plot` function to graph it
